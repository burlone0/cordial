// FPS Flex — take the frame-rate cap off, or put a specific one back.

// Roblox's Android build asks Vulkan for FIFO, which locks presentation to the
// display's refresh. On a phone that is the right answer and on a 60 Hz panel
// nobody notices. On a desktop with a faster panel it is the difference between
// the monitor you bought and the one the engine assumes you have.
//
// Cordial reads one FastFlag-layer key, `CordialPresentMode`, and hands the
// answer to `vkCreateSwapchainKHR`. This plugin sets that key. It never learns
// a swapchain exists, cannot name a mode the driver does not advertise, and
// cannot reach any other Vulkan call: the effect, never the channel (ADR-007).
//
// It also cannot overrule you. The flag layering puts the user's own
// `flags.json` above every plugin's, so a mode you set by hand wins over this
// and there is nothing this file can do about it.
//
// **Off by default**, and the reason is not caution for its own sake: uncapping
// presentation makes the GPU work as hard as it can for frames nobody asked
// for, which on a laptop is heat and battery. A plugin that shipped enabled
// would change how somebody's machine behaves without their having chosen it.
//
// ## This file did nothing at all until 2026-08-28
//
// Both of the calls it made were wrong, and neither failure was visible. It
// asked for `settings.read`, which is a *capability* name and not a method —
// the method is `settings.get` — and it sent `flags.set` a `{key, value}` pair
// when the handler requires `{values: {...}}`. So the present mode was never
// written, on any machine, for the whole time this shipped as a built-in
// plugin that Settings advertises by name.
//
// Nothing caught it because nothing ran it: the plugin tests in
// `crates/cordial-plugins` drive `host::Session`, which the client never
// constructs, and the host the client does run is
// `crates/cordial-runtime/src/plugin_host.rs`. `plugin_call_shapes.rs` now
// checks every method these shipped plugins name against the one closed table
// both hosts agree on, which is the half of this that a test can hold.
