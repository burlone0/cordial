//! Counts the graphics calls Roblox makes.
//!
//! "The engine took the surface" and "the engine is drawing" are different
//! claims. Nothing in the log distinguishes them, and a window can look plausible
//! while the compositor is painting all of it. Counting the calls that only a
//! rendering engine makes — creating a window surface, clearing, drawing,
//! swapping — settles it either way.
//!
//! These wrap the host's real functions and forward, so they cost a counter
//! increment and one relaxed atomic load per call and change nothing else.
//!
//! **That sentence used to say "a counter increment per call" and was wrong**,
//! from the day it was written until 2026-08-26. The forwarding macro resolved
//! the host function *inside* the wrapper body, so every wrapped call also
//! allocated a `CString`, took glibc's global linker lock, walked the ELF link
//! map and freed the string again. `glDrawElements` is wrapped. Counting is
//! gated behind `CORDIAL_COUNT_GL`, so no shipped client ever paid it — but
//! **anything timed with the counters on was timing the allocator and the
//! loader too**, which makes this the exact failure this project keeps writing
//! rules about: an instrument that changes what it measures, next to a comment
//! saying it does not.
